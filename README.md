# Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset

## Description

This dataset contains information about patients that may or may not have suffered from a heart attack. The dataset can be used to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. 
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle website and contains various medical and demographic attributes.

## Dataset Columns

1. **age**: Age of the patient (in years).
2. **sex**: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female).
3. **cp**: Chest pain type.
   - 0: Typical angina
   - 1: Atypical angina
   - 2: Non-anginal pain
   - 3: Asymptomatic
4. **trtbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg) on admission to the hospital.
5. **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
6. **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
7. **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results.
   - 0: Normal
   - 1: Having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
   - 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
8. **thalachh**: Maximum heart rate achieved.
9. **exng**: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
10. **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot).
11. **slp**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
    - 0: Upsloping
    - 1: Flat
    - 2: Downsloping
12. **caa**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
13. **thall**: Thalassemia.
    - 0: Null
    - 1: Fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
    - 2: Normal blood flow
    - 3: Reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
14. **output**: Diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status).
    - 0: Less than or equal to 50% diameter narrowing (no heart disease)
    - 1: Greater than 50% diameter narrowing (has heart disease)
